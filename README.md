## An expense tracker with a unique twist on data entry

### ***Current version has some display and slider bugs need to be fixed

### Motivation
I've always dreamed of having an expense tracker that worked backward from account balance to exspense detail. So as my first react app I decided to attempt it.

### How it works:
- Quick and simple
- At the end of each day you enter your bank balance ("as I recieved regular SMS notifications this was alway easy").
- The app calculates the difference and prompts you to categorise the amount spent.

### Technical specifications
- Built using create react app and vanilla CSS
- The goal was to experiment with forms and sliders
- Neo-brutalist style was attempted as it seemed a nice fit
- Built for mobile first
- Local browser storage used for data storage
